# FaceDetection

I have made a real time face detection project.
It detects the number of faces in front of the web cam and highlights the faces.

I have made this project using C++ language and OpenCV.
IDE Used: Visual Studio 2022

**These are some of my learnings:**

**_OpenCV_**: OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly for real-time computer vision. OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. 
It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.

**_Visual Studio vs Visual Studio Code:_** Got to know these are two different setups.
Visual Studio only runs on macOS and Windows. VS Code can run on macOS, Windows as well as Linux. Not many professionally developed plugins are available for Visual Studio.
Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment, also known as an IDE.
VS Code comes with a wide range of professionally curated plugins and extensions to meet all kinds of editing and compiling needs.
Visual Studio Code is a code editor. A developer can easily edit their code.
